This is a short adaptation of the
[original course](https://github.com/m2dsupsdlclass/lectures-labs) though in
[Master Year 2 Data Science IP-Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-mathematiques-appliquees-statistiques/master-year-2-data-science)
by Olivier Grisel and Charles Ollion

## Table of contents

The course covers the basics of Deep Learning, with a focus on applications.

### Lab and Home Assignment Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks for the labs can be found in the `labs` folder of
the [github repository](https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/):

    git clone https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs

These notebooks only work with `keras and tensorflow`
Please follow the [installation\_instructions.md](
https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/blob/master/installation_instructions.md)
to get started.
